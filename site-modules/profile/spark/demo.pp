# From Glenn

# Iâ€™m quite happy for there to be a general covering of all Windows style things:

# Install a Windows Role â€“ Maybe HyperV or IIS?
# Install a Windows Feature â€“ Also something simple, but unrelated â€“ maybe Telnet Server?
# Configure something network related (say â€“ static IP address, or DNS servers)
# Add a custom registry key â€“ I donâ€™t mind if this is to a completely novel location with no effect e.g. HLKM\SOFTWARE\PUPPETDEMO\ThisDoesNothing
# Install an application â€“ doesnâ€™t have to be fancy, 7Zip or other GNU is fine.
# Demonstrate something which requires a reboot to complete, and continuing after a reboot. Even something simple like:
# Create a text file
# Write the time to it
# Reboot device and wait for recovery
# Add a new line to the text file with the time




# From Shane

# I would like to get more details on multi tenanting, leveraging the role based access.   
# Keen to understand if we could setup a "Spark" based Puppet infrastructure and service smaller customers out of there or 
# Master Puppet instance managing child instances.  I guess along the lines of Puppet as a service (PaaS ðŸ™‚). 
# Good way to maintain our IP and central management and automation.
